            <h3>Project:</h3>
            <p class="body-text">Lava was created with one single purpose in mind. Sharing the best parties with everyone. Everywhere. We were tired of paying expensive entrance feeâ€™s to clubs only to be met by an almost empty room with a dull atmosphere. On that note the first idea of Lava was born, an application that would lead you straight to where the party is. Anywhere in the world.</p>

            <h3>Role &amp; Impact:</h3>
            <h4>Project Lead, Art Direction</h4>
            <p class="body-text">During this project I took on the role of Project Lead and Art Direction. I literally had my fingers in every piece of the project, from user research and interface design, to business planning and presentation. I lead the team from start to finish with one singular purpose; to make Lava amazing, together with amazing people. I made sure everything was on track for every deadline, and I quality assured every single piece of work we presented to the client.</p>
