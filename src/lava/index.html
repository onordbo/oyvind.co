            <h3>Project:</h3>
            <p class="body-text">Lava was created with one single purpose in mind. Sharing the best parties with everyone. Everywhere. We were tired of paying expensive entrance fee’s to clubs only to be met by an almost empty room with a dull atmosphere. On that note the first idea of Lava was born, an application that would lead you straight to where the party is. Anywhere in the world.</p>

            <h3>Role &amp; Impact:</h3>
            <p class="body-text">During this project I took on the role of Project Lead and Art Direction. I literally had my fingers in every piece of the project, from user research and interface design, to business planning and presentation. I lead the team from start to finish with one singular purpose; to make Lava amazing, together with amazing people. I made sure everything was on track for every deadline, and I quality assured every single piece of work we presented to the client.</p>
