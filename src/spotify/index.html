            <h3>Project:</h3>
            
            <p class="body-text">Spotify Match is an interactive campaign concept, based on a simple insight: People love discussing music. We took this insight and turned it into the campaign: <em>«Spotify Match – Discover music that you’ll love. Together.»</em></p>

            <p class="body-text">Spotify Match is an interactive social campaign, that aims to strengthen Spotify as a platform for creating new connections with people that share the same love for music as Spotify does.</p>

            <p class="body-text">We wanted to grow the Spotify brand to more than just delivering music to the entire world. We wanted people to believe that Spotify can be a true hub for the social music community. A place where people can connect with one another.</p>

          <h3>Role &amp; Impact:</h3>
          <h4>Conceptualization, User Interface Design</h4>

          <p class="body-text">I lead the initial brainstorming team, and ran a design team of three individuals. Over the course of three weeks, we took the concept from a fluffy idea, to a ready to go concept with high-fidelity mockups to illustrate our ideas.</p>

          <p class="body-text">I specifically, designed the mockups of the user-interface that we presented to the user upon landing on our campaign site. Furthermore I built iterations together with my team for the remainders of the visual pieces for the campaign.</p>
