            <p class="body-text">I love war rooms. I think they should be filled with awesome people, whiteboards and colored markers. I like Post-Its as I like my posters, on the wall and filled with awesome ideas. Small agile teams working together towards a common goal is my jam.</p>

            <h3>Toolkit:</h3>
            <p class="body-text">I like to keep my digital toolbox lean and simple, with as few effective tools to do as many things as possible. I love trying out new tools, and if something better comes along than what I'm currently using, I usually jump on the bandwagon as soon as I can. I’ve mentioned that I work mainly with <a href="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch 3</a> and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. They are the bread and butter of my projects, and I couldn’t live without them. I tend to relapse back to my Adobe package from time to time, but that’s usually only for some image editing. I'm also a huge fan of collaborative version control. <a href="https://github.com/onordbo" target="_blank">Check out my Github profile.</a></p>

            <h3>Product Iteration Model:</h3>
            <p class="body-text">During my time at Hyper Island I attended an amazing lecture by Product Designer Cas Lemmens from Spotify. He completely dunked my workflow on it’s head when he told us how they work at Spotify. It’s so simple, yet so effective. I instantly took this workflow into my own, and shifted all my projects to the iterative workflow model:</p>

            <h3 class="text-center build">Think it. Build it. Ship it. Tweak it.</h3>

      <img id="iterate" src="img/iterate.svg">

      <div class="container">
          <div class="col-md-12">

            <!-- Body text -->
            <p class="body-text">So simple, yet super effective. The iteration starts off with assumptions and hypothesis about our users. Those assumptions and hypothesis are built directly into a minimum viable product.</p>

            <p class="body-text">It then leads into an experiment where you test your product on whoever is in your target group. Then you take in the feedback from your experiment, research and compile it into your next iteration.</p>

            <p class="body-text">And then -> <span class="nerd">repeat.above();</span></p>

            <h3>Spatial Memory:</h3>
            <p class="body-text">I love to build spatial memory when I work, which is why I tend to build tiny war rooms for all my projects. It really helps the early stages of a proejct, because spatial memory > short term memory. You recall so much more from visual thinking, rather than a large list on a computer screen. Problem solving through visual elimination and brainstorming is the key to efficiency when you're working in a team. In the words of Jake Knapp, Design Partner at Google Ventures; this is why spatial memory is awesome:</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p class="body-text quote">
              To solve a complex design problem, you need to track lots of moving parts. As humans, our short-term memory is not all that good—but our spatial memory is awesome. Plaster a room with notes and you take advantage of that spatial memory. You begin to know where information is, which extends your ability to remember things. <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3028471/google-ventures-your-design-team-needs-a-war-room-heres-how-to-set-one-up" target="_blank">– Jake Knapp, Google Ventures</a></p>

            <h3>Hacking:</h3>
            <p class="body-text">The idea is done, the user stories are written. I’ve ran out of Post-its and Sharpies probably five times. It’s time to turn on the coffee machine, fire up Sketch and do some wireframing.</p>
