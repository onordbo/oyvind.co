            <p class="body-text">This is the creative task for my Digital Media Creative admission to Hyper Island, and it is <span class="italic">currently</span> only a concept. The task was to create a digital solution/service/product that were set ten years into the future.</p>

            <h3>Problem:</h3>
            <p class="body-text">I had this problem when I started working out, five months ago. I didn’t know anything about exercising right, or fitness in general. I just gambled about in the gym on the machines, assuming that if I wore myself out every time, I would just naturally progress. And in essence you can, but it’s not very effective, and if you're doing it wrong, you can hurt yourself. <span class="bold">A lot.</span></p>

            <p class="body-text">The world is already filled with a vast amount of wearable fitness technology, wristbands, apps, dongles, etc. They do all sorts of amazing things and track all sorts of data. But what good does that data do if you don’t understand it?</p>

            <h3>Solution:</h3>
            <p class="body-text">Introducing Shapr, a smart rubberband that tracks all your vitals. It's the personal coach that knows everything about your health, that can always tell you what to do to progress efficiently. It’s constantly monitoring your health, and translates that into data you can understand, so you can focus on the important parts; <span class="bold">like actually going to the gym.</span></p>
